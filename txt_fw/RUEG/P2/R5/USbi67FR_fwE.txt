Hello, I witnessed the case F 16. There was two people walking on the road, a man with a soccer ball and a woman with a baby in her stroller. 
It all started when the man and the women were going to cross the road but the man suddenly dropped his soccerball causing it to roll across the road. 
Across the road, there was a black car with a woman standing outside of her car. She had a small a dog and a bag with some apples. 
When the soccerball rolled across the road the dog started to chase it and the ladies apples rolled out of her bag
 Behind the soccer ball and the dog, two cars, a blue and a white car slightly crashed against one another. 
This happened because the first car(the blue one) stopped suddenly on the road in front of the soccer ball and the dog. 
The white car was behind the blue one and it didn't expect the blue one to stop suddenly on the road. 
This caused it to slightly crash into the car infront. The man who lost ahold of his soccerball helped the lady pick up her apples and quickly called 911.
 He then came up to the drivers of those two cars to sort things out.
