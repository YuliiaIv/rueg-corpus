There were two people walking down the sidewalk, along the parking lot. One of them was a woman with a stroller, the other one was a young man with a soccer ball.
Across from them, on the other side of the lot, there was a woman with her dog and groceries. Then, two cars, a blue one and a white one, pulled into the parking lot. Suddenly, the dog 
started barking at the blue car, which was ahead of the white one. The driver of the blue car slammed on the brakes, and the white car behind did the same. However, the white car did not stop
soon enough and ran into the blue car. The young man, mentioned earlier, went over to the woman with the groceries and helped her pick them up and made sure that she was alright.
The two drivers stepped out of their vehicles and began discussing something before calling the police.
