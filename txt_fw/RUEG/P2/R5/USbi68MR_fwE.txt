What I saw was a family of 3 crossing the street. 2 parents and baby in a stroller. Across the street was a lady putting a grocery bag in her car while holding her dog on a leash.
Then from the distance 2 cars were driving on that parking lot. Then when the family of 3 was crossing the road/parking lot , the dad was dribiling a soccer ball. Then it rolled in front of
one of the cars as it was still driving and the dog started barking , so the car quickly stopped and the other car hit it from behind. Becuase of that the lady dropped her groceries in 
front of the car.Then the dad from the family of 3 was helping the lady get her groceries back in the bag. The 2 drivers got out of the car and one of them called 911. Then the dad from the 
family of 3 walked over to the drivers. That is all I saw. But I assure you no one was hurt during this incident.
