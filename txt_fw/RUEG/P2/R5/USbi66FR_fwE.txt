There was a woman getting out of her car with grocery bags and a dog. Then, a blue car came into the intersection and a white car was following it and crashed into its rear. The woman looked scared and dropped her grocery bags and dog stuff spilled out. A man came from across the street to help her pack everything back up. Meanwhile, the drivers of the two cars came out of their carrs and inspected them for damage. The second driver called 911 on his iPhone.
