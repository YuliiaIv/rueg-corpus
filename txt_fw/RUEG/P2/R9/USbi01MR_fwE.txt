I first saw the young man with the soccer ball accompanied by the woman with the stroller. Across from them, a woman with a small dog was unloading groceries from her car as the vehicles rounded the corner.

As the man approached the dog, he lost control of the ball, leading the dog to jump up suddenly and start barking. The blue vehicle, which was close by, braked suddenly and the white vehicle crashed into it.

The young man helped the woman pick up her groceries as the drivers of the cars called 911.
