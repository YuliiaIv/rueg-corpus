A young couple were walking on one side of the street, the man was bouncing a ball while they were walking. Across the street, a woman was putting groceries into her trunk and her dog was
standing beside her. Two cars were driving across the street between them when the man dropped his ball and the woman's dog opposite them went running after the ball. In order not to hit
the dog, the driver in the first car came to a sudden stop and the car behind him collided into him. Nobody was injured.
