A young couple was walking along the sidewalk with a baby stroller, the guy was bouncing a soccer ball.  The ball got away from him.  A woman with a small dog was unloading groceries 
from her car nearby.  Her dog ran after the ball.  A car driving along the way stopped suddendly to avoid hitting the dog, and the car traveling behind rear-ended the first car.  
It doesn't seem to me that anyone is at fault in this accident--it happened only because of the dog.
