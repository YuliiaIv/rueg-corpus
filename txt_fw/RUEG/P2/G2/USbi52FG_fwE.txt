The accident that occurred today was completely accidental. Basically, a man was walking with his wife and child, and he was dribbling a soccer ball. The ball hit his foot and rolled
into the street. There was another woman with a dog who was standing acrss the street, holding a bag of apples. The dog saw the ball roll into the street and lunged into the street to 
try to get it. The owner of the dog ran and picked up her dog, while the man who dropped the soccer ball also came over to help her pick up her spilled groceries. Meanwhile, there were 
two other cars who were coming down the street at this exact time. The first car stopped abruptly as to not hit the dog, which caused the car behind it to accidentally hit it. The owner
of the first car called 911, and the man who dropped his soccer ball went over to both cars to make sure everyting was okay.
