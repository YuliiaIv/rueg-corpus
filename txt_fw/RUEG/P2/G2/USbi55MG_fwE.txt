I just saw two cars enter a parking lot and the one hit the othe from the back becuase it made a sudden stop. A guy was on one side of the parking lot and he droped his ball and it rolled to the other side. There was a dog on the other side that went to get the ball. The first car didn't want to hit it so it stoped and the car behind it hit it. This seems to have happened in Europe because of the plates of the car. The parking lot seems to be a parking lot of a holtel of condo or apartlemt complex of some sort.
