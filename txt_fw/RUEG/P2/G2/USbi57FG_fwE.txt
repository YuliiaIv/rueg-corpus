I was walking down the road when I saw a couple strolling along with a baby in a carriage. The guy was playing around with a ball and at some point it slipped from his hand and fell into the middle of the road. As he did that, and women who was putting away her groceries, lost her balance as her dog ran after the ball. she dropped all her belongings and they also rolled into the middle of the road. Unfortunately, there was a blue car coming and the driver quickly slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting everything that was now in the middle of the road. The blue car got into a crash since it was stopped it got rear-ended by the white car behind it. Lastly, the two drivers and the man who was playing with the ball called the police to notify you of what had just happened.
