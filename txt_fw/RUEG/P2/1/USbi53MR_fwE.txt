I was walking alongside the parking lot of a large striped black and white building when I saw a minor traffic accident (#f16). A man was walking alongside the parking lot with his wife;
the man was tossing a ball around and bouncing it on the groung while his wife was pushing a baby carriage. On the other side of the parking lot a woman with a dog on a leash was taking
groceries out of her car. In the distance two cars could be seen entering the parking lot, a blue car followed by a white car. The cars approached us as the man and his wife turned to cross
the parking lot. The man bounced his ball against the curb, and it bounced across the lot towards the dog who dashed after the ball. The dog pulled on his leash so hard that the woman dropped
her groceries. The blue car, ahead of the white one, was able to see this and stopped almost immediately, while the white car wasn't able to do this and crashed into the rear bumper of the
blue car. Both drivers got out of the car and began to discuss the accident, but the driver of the blue car made sure to check if overyone was okay first, which they were. The man with the ball
starte to help the woman with the dog pick up her groceries, and then joined the two drivers' discussion after he was done. Finally the driver of the blue car called 9-1-1.
