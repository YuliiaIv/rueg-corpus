Account from a witness of the F16 traffic infraction case.

I was walking down a city street when I became a witness of a minor traffic incident. A couple was walking with a baby carriage and a soccer ball and turned to cross the street. The man lost
control of the soccer ball and it rolled accross the street towards a woman unloading groceries from her vehicle. The woman was holding a dog on a leash that abruptly ran towards the uncontrolled
ball. A blue vehicle drove down the street as this event occured and was able to halt before causing injury to either the dog or the other pedestrians. A white vehicle driving at a similar speed
to the blue vehicle was not able to halt as quickly and rammed into the back of the blue vehicle. No one was injured and the vehicle damages were minimal. The drivers of the vehicles notified
authorities as quickly as were able.
