Hello, I am a witness to a car accident that recently happened on an office building parking lot. A woman was standing at the open trunk of her car, unloading her groceries with a dog on a leash. 
Meanwhile a man and his wife were walking down the sidewalk on the opposite side of the parking lot. The woman was pushing a stroller and the man wa bouncing a soccer ball. As the couple began the street towards the woman who is unloading her groceries, two cars started to pull into the parking lot. 
The man lost control of his ball and it began rolling infront of the first incoming car. The lady lost control of her dog and her groceries fell onto the street. In order to prevent running over the people and the dog, the first car abruptly stopped and the car directly behind it wasn't able to react fast enough, crashig into the rear of the first. As
As the man who lost the ball helped the lady pick up her fallen groceries, the drivers emerged from their cars and called the police. No one at the scene was hurt from the incident.
