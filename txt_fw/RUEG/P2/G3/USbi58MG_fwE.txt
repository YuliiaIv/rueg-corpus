Today, I saw an accident involving 2 families & 2 cars. One family was emptying groceries from their car, while the other family on the opposite side of the parking lot was walking their baby in a stroller... with the dad holding a soccer ball.
His ball slipped and rolled into the street, which triggered the dog to start barking and running after the ball. The family with the dog dropped some of the groceries they were holding, and the other family went to retrieve the ball. As soon
as the dog started barking at the ball and the groceries fell into the street, 2 cars were just pulling in and the sudden situation caused one to brake really hard. He broke so suddenly that the car behind him broke and rear-ended him, causing them both 
to get oout of theiur cars to examine the damage. The families in the situation picked up the things they each had dropped, while the people who crashed called 911.
