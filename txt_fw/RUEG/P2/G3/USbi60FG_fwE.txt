A student of some sort, was walking down a sidewalk with his girlfriend, but when it was time for them to cross the street, the kid 
dropped his ball onto the street; which caused a car to stop for him. But the car behind that one did not see the boy so they kept moving forwrd which caused them to crash into 
the car infront of them. A woman nearby dropped her bag of foods and her dog started barking too. The boy who dropped his ball helped the woman
with the dog get her things back in the bag. The man of the car that stopped for the boy called 911.
