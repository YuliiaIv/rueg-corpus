I saw 2 pedestrians walking on the side of the road, and one of them was holding a ball, and dropped it which then rolled into the street. On the other side of the street was a dog and its 
owner, and the dog saw the ball and chased after it into the middle of the street. 2 cars were driving down the street, and as soon as they saw the dog the first car abruptly stopped and the car behind it rear ended it. No one got hurt, but the 1st car and 2nd car hit each other. We called the police and are waiting for them to now investigate the situaton, and help out.
