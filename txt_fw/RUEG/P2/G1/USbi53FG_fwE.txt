I was standing at the corner of the street when a man walked by with his wife and child. The man, who was playing with a ball, dropped his ball and it rolled into the street. Two cars saw the ball in the middle of the road and halted, causing the car in back to hit the car in the front slightly. A lady on the opposite side of the road dropped her groceries trying to control her dog, who barked and tried to run as soon as it spotted the ball. The police were called by the man whose car was slightly dented in this episode.
