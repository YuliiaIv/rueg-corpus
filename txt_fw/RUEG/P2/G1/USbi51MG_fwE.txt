This is the officer involved with traffic accident F16.  A man dropped his soccer ball as he walked towards the street
causing the dog across the street to run after it.  Two cars were approaching this scene.  The first car stopped seeing
the dog, but the second car did not stop.  This caused the minor accident.  No injuries were reported but the police were
called and damage was done to the vehicle.
