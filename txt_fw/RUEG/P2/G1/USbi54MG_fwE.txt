I was going for a walk and I saw a man walking with his wife and his kid. He had a ball in his hands that he was bouncing, and as he was getting ready to cross the street he dropped the ball. In front of him, there was a dog with a lady who was putting groceries into her car. As the man dropped the ball, the dog went to chase it in the middle of the street. There was a car coming and it stopped very abruptly because of the dog. There was another car behind the one car, and he hit the man in front of him as he stopped abruptly.
