There was a lady on the scene who was packing bags of groceries into her car while holding her dog's leash. Meanwhile, a man was bouncing a soccer ball, and as he approached the end of the sidewalk that stopped at the main street, the ball hit his foot and rolled onto the street. The car that was approaching slammed on the brakes, causing the car behind him to crash into him. The lady's dog tried to get the ball, which caused the lady to drop her groceries, and some fruit fell onto the street. The man who was playing with the ball then helped the lady to get all of the fallen groceries back into the bag. He then helped the people involved in the car crash.
