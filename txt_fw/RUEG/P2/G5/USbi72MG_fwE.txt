The location of the accident was in a parking lot. There was a male and female walking with a stroller and across from them was a lady storing her groceryies in her car trunk with her dog. As the car approched the dog began to charge at the blue car and the blue car therefore came to an emediate halt. Unfortunatley there wasanother white car behind the blue car which did not stop so fast and rear ended the blue car. I feel that both cars were going to fast inside the parking lot and that the white car should have left distance to compensate for that.
