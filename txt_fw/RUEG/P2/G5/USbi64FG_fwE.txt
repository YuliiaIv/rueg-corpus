I was walking in the parking lot when i noticed a man dribbling a ball while he was walking with his wife snd child. There were beginning to enter the parking lot when another women was loading her groceries in her car while holding onto her dog with a leash. While his was happening two cars were beginning to enter the parking lot, the first car was ble and the second was white. As the man was dribbling his ball it rolled onto the road and cause the womens dog to run in the middle of the road to run after it. This caused the man in the blue car to break quickly. However, the man behind couldnt break in time so he crashed into his bumper. The husband asisted the women with her groceries and her dog, then went on to talk wih the two men who were involved in the crash while the called the police.
