I witnessed a minor accident.  A ball couple was walking with their baby, they had a ball that rolled out onto the street.  On the opposite side of the street a little dog saw the ball, ran after it in the middle of the road, and almost got hit by a car.  The first car stopped abruptly to avoid hitting the dog, and the second car hit the first car because he was following too closely.
