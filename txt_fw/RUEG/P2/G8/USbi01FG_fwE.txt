This is my witness account of the accident, regarding file number F16. I was a witness to a minor car accident in which two cars had a rear end collision. The cause of the accident 
could be one of two reasons. The first being a soccer ball being kicked into the street. The second being a dog running after the soccer ball and in front of the cars driving. The first
car stopped quickly and the second car either did not have enough space between them or didn't brake quickly enough to prevent an accident. In the end, both drivers were able to exit their
cars and assess the damage which proved that it was a minor car accident and that no one was injured .
