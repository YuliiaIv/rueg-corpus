To whom it may concern,

I witnessed a car crash today.  I saw that a family of a man, woman, and baby walking down the sidewalk while the man was bouncing a soccer ball.  As he was rounding the corner
to cross the street he lost control of the ball and it rolled across the street.  At the same time, a lady on the other sdie was putting grocery bags in her car while hlding on the leash
to her dog.  Upon seeing the soccer ball roll across the street, the dog started to bark and pull at the leash.  The lady dropped the grocery bag she was holding as the man chasing the ball 
helped her pick up her things.  Meanwhile, two cars are driving down this road and have to brake suddenly as the ball rolls across the street and the dog is barking.  The car in front brakes 
suddenly and the car behind ends up hitting the rear bumper of the car in front of him.  The man finishes helping the lady pick up her groceries and then ran over to the car accident to see if everyone is okay.  
The drivers seemed unharmed and called the police.
