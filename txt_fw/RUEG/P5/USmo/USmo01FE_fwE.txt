I was standing in a parking lot. There was a woman with a dog loading her car with groceries on one side and a man and woman walking with a stroller and a ball on the other. Right as two cars were about to drive through the parking lot, the man let his ball roll into the street, and the dog ran into the street to chase it. The cars both stopped abruptly to avoid hitting the dog, and the second car hit the first car's bender. The man ran to get his ball back and help to the woman pick up her groceries, and the two car drivers, both men, got out to check the damage. One of the drivers then called 911.
