while i was walking i noticed a man and woman walking with their child. the man was bouncing what looks to be a soccor ball. thwere was a woman acorss from them packing away her groceries in her car holding on to her dog. the man lost control of the ball while 2 cars were coming a blue and white car. the dog did chase after the ball in the middle of the street which caused the bleu car to suddenly stop and the white car had hit the blue car. the man bouncing the ball had went ot help the woman who had droped some of the groceries and assisted in picking them up. he then wnent over to the car owners and to see if they were hurt while someone had called 911.
