The couple with the baby carriage were approaching the crosswalk area from curbside as the two vehicles were taking the corner, and as they reached the crossing point, the male of the baby carriage group lost control of their soccer ball and it rolled out into the street. This caused the other, female witness's dog to rush forward toward the ball and I believe that scared the driver in the front car to brake hard. The driver behind did not brake in time, or could not, and then rearended the vehicle in front.
