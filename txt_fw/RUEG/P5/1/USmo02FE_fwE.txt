My name is Meredith Clark and I am reporting on the accident that accured today, F16.  There was a family walking down the sidewalk and the father was bouncing a soccerball next to the woman puching the stroller.  When they came to cross the street the ball bounced off the mans foot and roller accross the street. On the other side of the street there was a woman loading groceries into her car and was holding a dog on a leash. When the ball rolled out in front of the dog, the dog barked and chased after it.  The two cars that were coming down the street came to a quick stop however it was so fast that the second car rear ended the first car.  However no one was hurt and 911 was called.
