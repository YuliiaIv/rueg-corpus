12/1/18, 10:50 - Mary: Hi. You will not believe what just happened. A man was playing with a ball on the sidewalk, and the ball hit his foot and rolled on to the street. Meanwhile, a lady was packing groceries into her car while holding her dog on a leash. The dog went to get the ball, causing the lady to drop her groceries. A car that was driving on the street slammed on the brakes, causing the car behind him to crash into his car.
