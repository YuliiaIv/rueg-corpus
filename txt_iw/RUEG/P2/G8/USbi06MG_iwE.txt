11/11/18, 17:03 - Mary: hey dude, i just saw an accident. a husband and wife were walking their baby in a stroller and the man was bouncing a soccer ball. as they were about to cross the street the guy lost control of the ball and it started rolling across the street! on the other side was a lady putting grocery bags in her trunk and her dog began barking at the soccer ball rolling past him. thats when the cars were driving up to them and had to suddenly brake, with the second car hitting the first one. the man then walked over to the cars and made sure no one was hurt. pretty sure they were gonna call the cops.
