I saw a minor car accident when either the person driving saw a soccer ball roll into the street or when he saw a dog move in front of his car. Everyone is fine because they were both able to get out of their cars to assess the damage and the man who kicked the soccer ball also checked on them. What I found most interesting was the fact that the driver of the first car checked to see if he hit anything in the front of his car because assessing the damage to the back of his car.
