10/7/18, 18:28 - Mary: Hey Trent! I was walking past this giant striped building and I saw a car accident. This guy was walking along the side of the parking lot with his wife. He was tossing around a ball while his wife was pushing a baby carriage. On the other side of the parking lot there was a lady with a small dog on a leash and she was taking groceries out of her car. In the distance there were two cars driving up to us on the parking lot. A blue car was followed by a white one. All of the sudden the man and his wife decide to cross the street but the guy drops his ball and it rolls off of his foot across the parking lot. The lady's dog tries to run across the street after the ball and it pulls on the leash so hard the lady drops her groceries. The driver of the blue car seemingly saw the dog dash across the parking lot and stopped immediately but the car behind him wasn't able to stop so fast and hit the blue car in the back bumper. Both drivers stepped out and began to discuss after the driver of the blue car checked to make sure everyone was okay. The guy with the ball helped the lady with the dog pick up her groceries, and then joined the drivers in discussing. The guy from the blue car called the police. No one is hurt though, everything is fine!
