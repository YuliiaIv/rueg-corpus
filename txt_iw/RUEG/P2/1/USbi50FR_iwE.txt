10/6/18, 15:49 - Mary: hey whats up? so i just say this car accident that happened on a parking lot. a woman was unloading groceries from her trunk and she had a dog on a leash with her. meanwhile on the opposite side a man whos bouncing a ball is about to cross the parking lot with his wife whos pushing a stroller. as the couple begins to cross the lot two cars pull into the parking row. the guy drops his ball and the dog runs for it (his owner drops her groceries.) the first car sharply stops so it wouldnt hit them but the second car doesnt react in time and crashes into the first one's rear. no one was hurt, but the drivers got out of their cars and called the police as the guy helped the woman pick up her groceries.
