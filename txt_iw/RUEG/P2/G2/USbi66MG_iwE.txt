10/27/18, 10:52 - Mary: Hi mom just wanted to let you know that i almost got in an accident       today. I was walking on the sidewalk when a car turned into the parking lot and almost hit four pedestrians. Once the car stopped it got hit by another car behind it. The  four pedestrians included two women, a man, and a  baby. There was also a dog involved that almost got hit by the car. After the accident the man helped one of the ladies pick up the groceries that she dropped. Anyway, hope your having a good day.
