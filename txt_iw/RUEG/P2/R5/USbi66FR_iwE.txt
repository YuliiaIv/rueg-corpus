9/29/18, 15:50 - Mary: There was a woman unloading things from her trunk and watching her dog at the same time. All of a sudden, her dog starts barking because two cars pull in and the second car crashed into the first one. She scooped it up while a guy comes and helps her pack up again. Meanwhile, the drivers inspected their cars for damage  and one of them called 911.
