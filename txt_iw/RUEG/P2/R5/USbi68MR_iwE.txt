9/30/18, 17:25 - Mary: Hey man I just saw a car crash. It happened on a parking lot. So 2 cars were driving from a distance. A lady was putting her grocery bag in her car while holding her dog on a leash . Then a family of 3(a mom,dad and a baby in a stroller) were crossing the parking lot. And the dad was dribbling a soccer ball and the ball rolled out in front of the cars. So the dog started barking and the car stopped. And the car behind it hit the car from behind. The ladies dropped her grocery bag. So the dad helped pick it up. The two drivers got out and one of them called 911. Then the dad walked over to them.That's all I remember. Thank god no one got hurt.
