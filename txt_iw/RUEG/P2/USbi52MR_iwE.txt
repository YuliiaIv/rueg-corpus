10/7/18, 19:48 - Mary: hey, i saw an accident today, with two cars
10/7/18, 19:48 - Mary: it was a really small and slow speed collision but nonetheless
10/7/18, 19:48 - Mary: basically a white volkswagen golf rear-ended a blue renault hatch after a turn in the parking lot of my apartment building
10/7/18, 19:48 - Mary: i was walking home and a couple walking towards me (woman had stroller and man was bouncing soccer ball) went to approach a crosswalk
10/7/18, 19:48 - Mary: as they came up to it the man dropped his ball because he heard the blue car approaching and rolled his ball across the street accidentally
10/7/18, 19:48 - Mary: the car slammed on their brakes since they weren't slowing down as they didn't see him and didn't expect anyone to he there because of a bih white van blocking the drivers vision
10/7/18, 19:48 - Mary: the second car turned in right after the first abd just didn't have time to stop because he was too close and he ran into the guy in front.
10/7/18, 19:48 - Mary: no one was hurt and everyone walked away fine. police were notified and called to the scene. that's basically it
