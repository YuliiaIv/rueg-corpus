11/3/18, 12:28 - Mary: Hey mom, today I saw an accident 2 families were walking into a parking lot... one with a dog and the other eith a kid in the stroller. The dad with the kid dropped his soccer ball, and the dog from the other family began barking and running after it. While this was all happening, 2 cars were coming into the parking lot and as soon as they saw everything the one car broke hard and the car behind them hit them.
