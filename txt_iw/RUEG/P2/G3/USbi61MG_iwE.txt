11/10/18, 10:22 - Mary: hi Ethan, you'd never guess what happened! I was walking down the street when I saw a woman with her kid walking, and he was holding a ball. Across the street was a woman loading groceries into her  car with her small dog. As all this was happening, a blue car sped around the corner, followed by a white car close behind. The kid dropped his ball onto his foot, and it rolled into the street, where the dog jumped after it. The blue car stopped suddenly, but the white cad behind couldn't, so it slammed right into the back of the blue car. Nobody was hurt.
