12/1/18, 12:09 - Mary: hey-texting you to tell you i saw an accident. 2 people were walking on the side of the road, and one of them was playing with a ball and dropped it into the street. A dog from the other side went into the road to chase after the ball, and a car coming down the road and stopped abruptly, and another car from behind rear ended it. we called the police and are waiting for them, and it would be a great help if you were able to come and help. thanks!
